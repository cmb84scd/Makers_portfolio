## Process for starting a project

- [] Receive requirements from client
- [] Write user stories if required
- [] Get further info (and make suggestions) such as
  - How the input will be provided, ie an argument
  - What the expected output will be
- [] Do diagrams/tables such as
  - Input/Output table
- [] Set up project
  - Create folder and do git init
  - bundle init (for Ruby projects)
  - rspec --init (for Ruby projects)
  - Create spec file, lib directory and .rb file
- [] Write first test and keep it simple! Test for simplest normal input first
