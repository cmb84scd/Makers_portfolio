#### The basics of how the web works!

The web is a system for publishing pages of information on the internet. All the pages are stored on servers and can be accessed by a user anywhere in the world. To access the information, the user types the address of the page into a browser (Google for example), the browser then goes to the server to get the page information, the server returns the information to the browser and finally the browser displays the information (page) to the user. This is the request/response cycle.

Here are some other useful bits, which I knew about and use, but didn't really know what they meant!

URL - is Uniform Resource Locator and is the address of whichever page of a website you want to visit eg bbc.co.uk/uknews

DNS - is Domain Name Server and this matches the web address you type in, eg bbc.co.uk, to the website's actual address, an IP number. So the URL is full web address (as above) but the DNS is just the name for your web presence ie bbc.co.uk

IP address - Internet Protocol address and is a set of numbers and letters that allows you to use the internet. These would be difficult for users to remember, so that is where DNS comes in, giving us easy to remember names for websites.

HTML - is HyperText Markup Language is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. On it's own it would make for fairly boring websites, so by using CSS, and other scripting languages such as JavaScript, pages can be made more user friendly.

CSS - is Cascading Style Sheets and is used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language such as HTML. Using CSS means you can separate the content from the presentation ie: layout, colours and fonts.

HTTP - is HyperText Transfer Protocol and is an application protocol that defines a language for clients (browsers) and servers to talk to each other. This is what the browser uses to request a page and the server to send the page back to the browser.
