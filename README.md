## Welcome to my portfolio

This is where I'll be keeping track of my learning goals and progress during my time at Makers Academy.

Each week will be recorded separately and will be in the form of a single Google doc linked below. Also, there will sometimes be folders with docs in them. This will only happen if I've written about something and not actually done an exercise linked to it. If I have done an exercise then I will include some notes in the README for that exercise.

Here are my learning goals for [week 1](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LhfciaQ-DIQHX7Km4My68Ck0BCsDCRQBLIeK9G80abY/edit?usp=sharing)
