It's important to have a good debugging process as it will help you to solve the issue quicker.
My debugging process is as follows:

1. Carefully read the error message and note down any useful points for example line numbers.
2. If it's very obvious where the error is, ie it says you've used includes? but perhaps you meant include?, just fix it!
3. If not then check the spec file to see what the expected output is.
4. Use 'p' statements to improve visibility. Do this on both the spec file and project file.
5. If there's something I'm not sure of then Google it!

It's important to stick to this process as it means I will be more effective at debugging and if I do drift off, I need to ensure I return to the process!
