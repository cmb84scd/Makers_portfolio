#### Why do TDD and what is the process?

By doing TDD it means you are testing your code every few minutes, thus reducing the need for debugging and speeding up the development. It helps to keep your code clean and also means you end up writing only the minimal amount of code required to pass the test.

The most important thing to remember is to write a test, then write the code to pass the test.
Only write the least amount of code required to pass the test.
Only move onto the next test once the previous one has passed. Don't write several tests at once, just do one at a time.

Rules: Write a failing test (Red), write code to pass the test (Green), refactor as/if necessary and repeat!
