A couple of examples of Object Oriented programming principles are encapsulation and single-responsibility principle(SRP).

SRP is where every module or class should have responsibility over a single function of the software, and that responsibility should be entirely encapsulated by the class, module or function.

Encapsulation is where you put the information, and methods that work on that information, into a single unit such as a class.

An example of this would be a simple calculator. You would have a class just for the actual functions and in this class you would define +, -, *, /. Then you would have a method outside of the class or another class where you would call these functions so that you can do basic maths.
Here I am encapsulating the behaviour of the calculator into one class and user functionality into another.
